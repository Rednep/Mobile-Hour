# Mobile Hour E-commerce Web Application ðŸ“±

## Project Scenario

Welcome to the repository for the Mobile Hour E-commerce application, a web solution for an online business specializing in selling top-brand mobile phones.

Mobile Hour, previously relying on a rather outdated website, wanted to revamp its online presence, focusing on design, functionality, and, crucially, security. As an entrusted web developer from Uptown IT's Creative Department, I was assigned to design and develop a completely new website, keeping these considerations at the forefront.

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹

The project demanded a responsive website capable of accommodating multiple devices and integrating a database. This was essential for allowing admin users to manage the products effectively and securely. 

### Key Features & Functionality ðŸ”‘

- **Responsive Design**: The website is built to be responsive and deliver a seamless user experience across multiple devices.
- **Admin User Access**: Secure login to the admin area, ability to add new admin users (restricted to managers), modify user accounts, and manage product listings (add, update, and delete products).
- **Stock Management**: Track stock on hand and maintain a comprehensive change log to identify what, when, and who made changes.
- **Dynamic Data Display**: Ability to display all mobile phones, sort and display by brand or price, display stock on hand by product and by brand, and display current users. A detailed change log is also available, filterable by product, date, and user.

## Technical Stack ðŸ’»

The backend of the application is built with Node.js and Express, and uses MySQL2 for the database. For templating, we use EJS. Authentication and session management are handled using bcryptjs and express-session. Feather-icons are used for iconography, and validator is used for data validation.

The Mobile Hour E-commerce web application stands as a testimony to my abilities as a web developer, balancing user experience, functionality, and security. Feel free to explore the project files and offer any feedback.
